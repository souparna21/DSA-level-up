/* Given a list of 'n' strings S0,S1,S2,.....,Sn-1, each consisting of digits
and spaces, the number of spaces is the same for each entry, the goal is
to implement a variation of sort command. None of the string contains
cosecutive spaces. Also, no string starts with a space into columns, which
can be used as keys in comparisons. */
